# Session: 2026-01-27 Setup

## Date
January 27, 2026

## Tasks Accomplished
1. ✅ Created global AI brain repository structure
2. ✅ Set up initial knowledge files:
   - coding-standards.md
   - tech-stack-preferences.md  
   - common-patterns.md
   - common-commands.md

## Decisions Made
- Chose Git-based global brain for version control and accessibility
- Organized knowledge into categories: global-knowledge, project-templates, workflows
- Used markdown format for easy editing and readability
- Placed brain in ~/.ai-brain for global access across projects

## Key Insights
- Global approach better than per-project brain for multi-project workflow
- Version control ensures knowledge persistence across machines
- Markdown provides good balance of readability and structure

## Next Steps
- Add project templates for common starters
- Create git workflow documentation
- Build habit of updating session logs after each session
- Consider adding quick reference guides for specific technologies

## Questions for User
- What other categories of knowledge should be included?
- How detailed should the session logs be?
- Any specific project types you work on frequently?

## Technologies Used
- Git for version control
- Markdown for documentation
- GitHub for remote backup and sync
