## 🛠 Smart Usage Examples

### Before Starting a Project
```
You: "I'm building a new e-commerce platform"
Me: "Based on your preferences, I suggest Next.js + TypeScript + 
     PostgreSQL. You've had 95% success with this stack. 
     Here's the starter template you liked from Project Alpha."
```

### During Development
```
Me: "I notice you're implementing complex state management. 
     In Project Beta, Zustand worked well. Should I apply that pattern?"
```

### Problem Solving
```
Me: "This debugging challenge is similar to one you solved last month. 
     You used the 'divide and conquer' approach which worked well. 
     Want to try that strategy again?"
```

### Learning Acceleration
```
Me: "Since you're learning advanced TypeScript, this is a perfect 
     opportunity to practice conditional types. I'll structure the 
     solution to demonstrate concepts you're working on."
```
