```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Global Knowledge**: Applies to all projects - your coding style, preferred tools
2. **Templates**: Quick starters for different project types
3. **Workflows**: Your preferred ways of working
4. **Session Logs**: Track what we accomplish and build institutional memory
5. **Project Context**: Lightweight references when needed

## 🔄 Maintenance

This brain evolves as we work together:
- New patterns discovered → Added to templates
- Better approaches found → Updated in best practices
- Completed tasks → Logged in session history
- New preferences → Documented in standards

## 📊 Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same quality and patterns across projects
- **Speed**: Quick access to proven solutions
- **Learning**: Builds institutional memory over time
- **Flexibility**: Global knowledge with project-specific context
- **Backup**: Git ensures your knowledge is safe and accessible

## 🛠 Usage

I'll automatically reference this brain when helping you with tasks to provide:
- Code that matches your style
- Solutions using your preferred tech stack
- Patterns that have worked for you before
- Commands and workflows you're familiar with
