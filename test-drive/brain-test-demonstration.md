[Web Design Guidelines] 100+ rules checked...
✅ Accessibility: ARIA labels for product filters
✅ Performance: Lazy load images with placeholder blur
✅ UX: Progressive disclosure for product options
✅ Mobile: Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum)

[Composition Patterns] Avoiding prop proliferation...
✅ Use compound components for product cards
✅ Extract product variation logic to custom hook
✅ Implement render prop pattern for flexible layouts
```

### **4. AI Tool Preparation (Ecosystem Integration)**

✅ Learning Style: Hands-on, progressive complexity
✅ Energy Level: Start with architecture (9-11 AM peak)
✅ Satisfaction Factors: Working code, clear explanations, learning

[Consistency Score] 0.94/1.0 maintained
✅ Using Zustand (your preferred state management)
✅ TypeScript strict mode (your quality standard)
✅ Tailwind CSS (your styling preference)
```

## 🎯 **Complete Personalized Recommendation**:

### **Tech Stack (Based on Your 95% Success Pattern)**:
```typescript
{
  frontend: "Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS",
  stateManagement: "Zustand",
  backend: "Node.js + Express + TypeScript", 
  database: "PostgreSQL + Redis (for inventory)",
  payments: "Stripe (you have existing patterns)",
  deployment: "Vercel (automated deployment ready)"
}
```

### **Architecture Pattern (Proven in Project Alpha)**:
```typescript
// Your preferred structure
src/
├── components/           # Compound components for products
├── hooks/               # Custom hooks for cart/inventory
├── stores/              # Zustand stores
├── pages/               # Next.js app router
├── api/                 # Express endpoints
└── types/               # TypeScript interfaces
```

### **Performance Optimizations (Vercel Best Practices)**:
```typescript
// Critical patterns from your successful projects
const ProductList = () => {
  // ✅ Parallel data fetching
  const [products, categories] = await Promise.all([
    fetchProducts(),
    fetchCategories()
  ]);
  
  // ✅ Virtual scrolling for galleries
  return (
    <VirtualizedList items={products}>
      {/* ✅ Lazy loaded images */}
      <ProductCard />
    </VirtualizedList>
  );
};
```

### **Development Workflow (Optimized for Your Schedule)**:
```
Today (9-11 AM): Architecture setup + core components
- Create Next.js project with TypeScript
- Setup Zustand stores for cart/inventory  
- Build compound ProductCard component
- Configure Tailwind with custom theme

Tomorrow: API development
- Express endpoints for products/inventory
- Stripe integration (reuse your patterns)
- Database schema with migrations

Day 3: Features & Testing
- Shopping cart logic
- User authentication
- E2E tests with Cypress
```

### **Predictive Problem Prevention**:
```
⚠️ Watch for: Inventory race conditions (you had this issue before)
⚠️ Monitor: Payment timeout on mobile (3.2% rate vs 1.1% desktop)
⚠️ Prepare: Custom product options (complex state management)
✅ Solutions ready: Retry logic, optimistic updates, proper validation
```

## 📊 **Real-Time Performance Tracking**:

### **Current Context**:
- **Energy Level**: 9/10 (Perfect for complex work) 
- **Focus Time**: 2 hours available
- **Confidence**: 94% (Based on similar project success)
