# Time Management & Productivity Patterns

## Daily Work Patterns
- **Peak Hours**: 9 AM - 12 PM (deep focus, complex problem solving)
- **Secondary Peak**: 2 PM - 5 PM (implementation, testing, documentation)
- **Wind Down**: After 6 PM (code review, planning, learning)
- **Energy Levels**: High in morning, moderate afternoon, creative thinking in evening

## Task Sequencing Preferences
1. **Start with**: Planning and architecture (when fresh)
2. **Move to**: Core implementation (during peak energy)
3. **Then**: Testing and debugging (moderate energy)
4. **End with**: Documentation and cleanup (lower energy)

## Work Session Structure
- **Pomodoro Style**: 50-minute focus, 10-minute break
- **Session Goals**: Clear, specific, measurable objectives per session
- **Context Switching**: Minimize - batch similar tasks together
- **Deep Work Blocks**: Minimum 2 uninterrupted hours for complex problems

## Productivity Tools & Methods
- **Task Management**: GitHub Issues for project tasks, personal notes for learning
- **Time Tracking**: Focus on completion over hours logged
- **Break Types**: Walk, stretch, or light reading - no screens during breaks
- **Focus Aids**: Background instrumental music, minimal notifications

## Anti-Productivity Patterns to Avoid
- **Context Switching**: Multiple unrelated projects in same day
- **Skipping Planning**: Jumping into code without understanding requirements
- **Perfectionism**: Over-optimizing before testing is complete
- **Meeting Overload**: Too many synchronous blocks breaking focus

## Energy Management
- **Creative Work**: Morning - architecture, design, complex algorithms
- **Mechanical Work**: Afternoon - implementation, testing, data entry
- **Review Work**: Evening - code review, documentation, learning
- **Planning Work**: End of day/week - retrospectives, next steps

## Sustainable Work Habits
- **Daily Review**: 10 minutes at end of day to assess progress
- **Weekly Reflection**: Friday afternoon to review learning and adjust patterns
- **Boundaries**: Clear start/end times, emergency exceptions only
- **Rest Strategy**: One screen-free evening per week, full disconnect weekends

## Seasonal Patterns
- **Winter**: Deep focus on complex projects, learning new technologies
- **Spring**: New project kickoff, experimentation, prototyping
- **Summer**: Refactoring, optimization, documentation
- **Fall**: Planning, architecture, preparing for winter deep work
