# AI Brain - Installable Knowledge System

A self-improving AI knowledge base that AI agents can install and update.

- **Knowledge** - Facts, patterns, and learnings organized by topic
- **Rules** - Behavioral guidelines and constraints
- **Personas** - Personality configurations for different contexts
- **Skills** - Capabilities and how-to guides
- **Memory** - Persistent context across sessions
